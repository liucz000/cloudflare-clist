English | [简体中文](./README_zh-CN.md)

## Features

- File storage and management
- Cloudflare Workers deployment
- D1 database integration
- Responsive web interface
- File preview capabilities
- Multi-storage backend support
- **WebDAV server support** - Access your storages via WebDAV protocol

## Prerequisites

Before deploying this application, ensure you have the following:

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager
- Cloudflare account with Workers enabled
- Wrangler CLI installed globally: `npm install -g wrangler`

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ooyyh/Cloudflare-Clist.git
cd Cloudflare-Clist
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

## Configuration

### Environment Setup

1. Log in to Cloudflare:
```bash
wrangler login
```

2. Create a D1 database:
```bash
wrangler d1 create clist
```

3. Update the `wrangler.jsonc` file with your specific database ID and environment variables:
```json
{
  "vars": {
    "VALUE_FROM_CLOUDFLARE": "Hello from Cloudflare",
    "ADMIN_USERNAME": "your_admin_username",
    "ADMIN_PASSWORD": "your_secure_password",
    "SITE_TITLE": "Your Site Title",
    "SITE_ANNOUNCEMENT": "Welcome to CList storage service!",
    "CHUNK_SIZE_MB": "10"
  },
  "d1_databases": [
    {
      "binding": "DB",
      "database_name": "clist",
      "database_id": "your_database_id_here"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Database Migrations

Run the database migrations to set up the required tables:

```bash
wrangler d1 migrations apply clist
```

## Development

To run the application in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server with hot reloading.

## Building

To build the application for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates optimized builds for both client and server.

## Deployment

### Deploy to Cloudflare Workers

To deploy the application to Cloudflare Workers:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This command will:
1. Build the application
2. Deploy it to Cloudflare Workers

### Manual Deployment

Alternatively, you can build and deploy separately:

```bash
npm run build
wrangler deploy
```

### GitHub Actions Deployment

See the GitHub Actions workflow guide: [GITHUB_WORKFLOW_DEPLOY.md](./GITHUB_WORKFLOW_DEPLOY.md)

## Environment Variables

The application uses the following environment variables:

- `ADMIN_USERNAME`: Administrator username for accessing the service
- `ADMIN_PASSWORD`: Administrator password for accessing the service
- `SITE_TITLE`: Title displayed on the website
- `SITE_ANNOUNCEMENT`: Announcement text shown on the homepage
- `CHUNK_SIZE_MB`: Maximum file chunk size in MB for uploads
- `WEBDAV_ENABLED`: Set to "true" to enable WebDAV server
- `WEBDAV_USERNAME`: WebDAV access username (optional, defaults to admin username)
- `WEBDAV_PASSWORD`: WebDAV access password (optional, defaults to admin password)

## WebDAV Configuration

### Enabling WebDAV

Set the following in Cloudflare Workers environment variables:

```json
{
  "vars": {
    "WEBDAV_ENABLED": "true",
    "WEBDAV_USERNAME": "your_webdav_username",
    "WEBDAV_PASSWORD": "your_webdav_password"
  }
}
```

### WebDAV Access URLs

Once enabled, access your storages via:

- All storages root: `https://your-domain/dav/0/`
- Specific storage: `https://your-domain/dav/{storage_id}/`

⚠️ **Important**: URLs must end with a trailing slash `/`

**Example**:
- ✅ Correct: `https://your-domain/dav/11/`
- ❌ Wrong: `https://your-domain/dav/11`

### Client Connection

- **Windows**: Map network drive with WebDAV URL (recommended: RaiDrive, NetDrive)
- **macOS**: Finder → Go → Connect to Server
- **Linux**: Use davfs2 or file manager
- **Mobile**: Use any WebDAV-compatible file manager app

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter a `405 Method Not Allowed` error:
1. Ensure `WEBDAV_ENABLED` is set to the string `"true"` (not boolean)
2. Make sure the URL ends with `/`
3. Verify authentication credentials

For detailed setup and troubleshooting, see [WebDAV Setup Guide](./docs/WEBDAV_SETUP.md)

## Database Schema

The application uses a D1 database with migrations located in the `migrations/` directory. The schema is defined in `schema.sql`.

## Local Preview

To preview the production build locally:

```bash
npm run preview
```

## Type Checking

To run TypeScript type checking:

```bash
npm run typecheck
```

This will generate Cloudflare types and run TypeScript compilation.
